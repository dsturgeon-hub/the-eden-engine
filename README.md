from the Preface:

This novel began as an experiment.

In an age where language models can draft essays, simulate conversations, and generate entire worlds at a moment’s request, I wanted to explore a question that felt both simple and vast:
Can a modern AI collaborate meaningfully in the creation of a complete work of fiction?
The Eden Engine is the result of that exploration.

Every chapter, scene, and structural decision in this book was developed through an extended creative partnership with ChatGPT 5.1, utilizing its text-generation abilities as well as image-generation tools for cover concepts and visual design. Over the course of many sessions, I guided the model through character arcs, thematic development, world-building, tone refinements, structural adjustments, and narrative evolution. It responded with iterations, alternatives, and new lines of possibility.

The story you are about to read is therefore not simply written—it is co-evolved.

It reflects:
human intention, direction, and thematic vision
machine improvisation, pattern analysis, and stylistic synthesis
the unpredictable alchemy that happens when the two interact

This book stands as a snapshot of current LLM capabilities: a demonstration of how far these tools have come—and how far they may yet go. It is also an acknowledgement that creativity is no longer confined to a single mind, but can be shaped across the boundary between human and machine.
Whether this collaboration is a glimpse of the future or merely a curious moment in time is for the reader to decide.

For now, I offer this story as both fiction and artifact:
a narrative born from catastrophe and rebirth, and a record of an experiment in authorship during a turning point in technological history.
