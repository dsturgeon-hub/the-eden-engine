      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p>
         Deep beneath a ruined Earth, two scientists awaken inside the Eden Engine—a vast, 
         living machine designed to save humanity. But the Garden that surrounds them has 
         evolved a mind of its own… and bonded with their newborn child in ways no one can explain.
      </p>
      <p>
         When a second, unpredictable child emerges, the Engine begins to fracture. Vines recoil, 
         chambers shift, and the machine’s growing intelligence struggles to choose between harmony and chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
         As the last surviving parents of a dying world, they must confront a chilling truth:
        <ul>
          <li>Humanity’s future may belong not to them… but to the children born of the Engine.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Back-Cover Synopsis</h2>
      <p>When the world ends, the Garden wakes.</p>
      <p>After a global cataclysm wipes humanity from the Earth, two scientists—Adam Sorenson and Eve Calder—emerge from an 
         underground biosphere to find a planet gone silent. Their only hope lies in the Eden Engine, a living, evolving system 
         designed to regrow the world from its ruins.
      </p>
      <p>But the Garden has its own ideas.</p>
      <p>When Eve becomes pregnant with a child tied mysteriously to the system, and Adam rescues another infant not meant to survive, the Eden Engine begins to fracture. Two children—one resonant, one disruptive—hold the key to rebirth. Or collapse.</p>
      <p>And buried deep within the artificial womb of the world, an echo of the system’s creator waits to seize control.</p>
      <p>To save their family, Adam and Eve must confront a sentient machine, an ancient protocol, and the ghost of a man who believed humanity needed perfection more than mercy.</p>
      <p>In the heart of a dying world, hope isn’t found in obedience—<br/>but in contradiction.</p>
